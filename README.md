# FIFO-Buffer-Design-Verilog-HDL-
Designed a 4-entry synchronous FIFO memory with separate read/write pointers and counter-based depth tracking.
Implemented full/empty flag logic, simultaneous read/write handling, and pointer wrap-around using behavioral Verilog. 
Created a dedicated testbench to validate write, read, overflow/underflow conditions, and clock-synchronous data flow.
